This is the extension of Wenrui Xu's GIdisk2obs (https://github.com/wxu26/GIdisk2obs), combining with pipelines to run RADMC-3D and produce images and spectra.

# disk_model.py
This is the modified version of Wenrui Xu's Class 0/I disk model.The main differences between these two versions are the opacity tables. To maintain self-consistency, the opacity tables in the disk_model.py are alterred with the opacities generated by optool.

# vertical_profile_class.py
Extend disk_model.py to spherical coordinates which RADMC-3D adopts.
